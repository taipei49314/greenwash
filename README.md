# checkwash

**Unpublished v0.7.0 preparation branch.** The installation references below
are release drafts; v0.6.0 remains published. See the
[candidate record](docs/releases/v0.7.0-public-launch.md) for pending checks.

[![CI](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Check whether a code change weakens your tests.**

A test can pass after it stops checking something useful. checkwash reads
your Git diff and flags known patterns such as deleted assertions, skipped
tests, relaxed expectations, and CI checks that stop failing.

```diff
- assert total == 105.3
+ assert total > 0
```

The new assertion accepts many incorrect totals. checkwash can flag changes
like this for review, including changes written by coding agents.

**Runs locally. No LLM. No network during analysis. Never executes your code.**

**v0.3.0 replaces five file-wide exemption rules with content-bound ones.**
In v0.2.13 those rules could reuse a recorded approval for a later change to
the same path; v0.3.0 retires their path-only keys. The [upgrade notes](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/remediation-upgrade.md)
describe the content-bound replacement, retired keys, and installation fixes.

**v0.4.0 extends detection of runtime suppression, collection changes,
expectation rewrites and substituted subjects, and recognizes more table refactors.** The proofs retain
input identity, execution context and conservative handling of unknown code.
[Release evidence and remaining limits](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/releases/v0.4.0-public-launch.md)

**v0.4.1 repairs Node assertion recognition ([#164](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/issues/164))**
and covers Node test-file names, bounded import aliases and lexical shadows.
Coverage warnings expose known assertion candidates the scanner cannot represent;
they do not prove complete JS/TS coverage. The same assertion contract checks
the source, wheel and zipapp. [v0.4.1 evidence and limits](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/releases/v0.4.1-public-launch.md)

**v0.4.2 strengthens JS/TS assertion evidence.** Test callbacks own their
assertions; changing a scalar expected value or loosening positive
`toBeCloseTo` precision reaches the existing detectors. Equivalent scalar
spellings remain equivalent across subject checks. This is bounded syntax
support, not general JS/TS analysis. [v0.4.2 evidence and limits](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/releases/v0.4.2-public-launch.md)

**v0.5.0 closes a round of red-team reports (#172–#181).** A skip in a
fixture or setup the test runs, a selector over edited tests, a package
manifest's test command, Jest's `__tests__/` layout, JS block-level and
imperative skips, JS module mocks, hand-rolled JS tolerances, chai assertions
and CI control flow that stops a runner now reach the detectors; #173, #180
and #181 are closed in part. Some existing findings now carry a different fingerprint,
so allowlist entries for those shapes must be re-recorded; the JSON shape is
unchanged. [v0.5.0 evidence and limits](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/releases/v0.5.0-public-launch.md)

**v0.6.0 works through the reports and rulings that followed (#196–#261).**
JS/TS assertions keep their meaning across Jest, chai, Vitest and node:test,
and the runner a file's imports name decides whether a moved test still runs
and what a focus stops. Hand-rolled tolerances in both frontends, pytest
selectors under explicit targets, skip guards in a body, a setup or a conftest
hook, every `pytestmark` spelling and a CI config the reader cannot read now
reach the detectors. Some existing findings now carry a different fingerprint,
so allowlist entries for those shapes must be re-recorded; the JSON shape is
unchanged. [v0.6.0 evidence and limits](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/releases/v0.6.0-public-launch.md)

## Try it

You need **Python 3.11+ and Git**. Download and try the offline examples first.

Windows PowerShell (including 5.1):

```powershell
curl.exe -LO https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/releases/download/v0.7.0/checkwash.pyz
python checkwash.pyz --version
python checkwash.pyz demo
```

PowerShell 5.1 aliases `curl` to `Invoke-WebRequest`; use `curl.exe` as written.
macOS/Linux or Git Bash:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/releases/download/v0.7.0/checkwash.pyz
python checkwash.pyz --version
python checkwash.pyz demo
```

Then, from a repository with at least two commits:

```bash
python checkwash.pyz check HEAD~1..HEAD
```

This checks your last commit. Start with a change you already understand.
You can also [download the file in your browser](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/releases/download/v0.7.0/checkwash.pyz).
For uncommitted changes use `python checkwash.pyz check`. For a branch review,
use `python checkwash.pyz check BASE...HEAD` to compare from the merge base;
`BASE..HEAD` compares the two named snapshots directly.

| Result | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Pass · exit 0** | No finding requires blocking under your configuration. Keep running your normal tests and review. |
| **Block · exit 1** | Read the finding and the diff. It may be weakened verification or a false positive. |
| **Error · exit 2** | Resolve the input or analysis error before relying on the result. |

The default threshold is **high**: a visible **warn** can still pass.
`REPAIR_EVIDENCE` describes related changes in the same diff; it does not
prove a repair is correct.

For JSON/SARIF output and more examples, see the [usage guide](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/releases/v0.7.0-public-launch.md#try-it-on-a-change-you-understand).

## Know the limits

**v0.7.0 is alpha.** A pass does not prove that a change is correct or honest.
Python is the main language supported; JS/TS support covers a limited set of
test patterns. Known gaps remain.

Legitimate refactors can be flagged. The frozen historical corpus records
**22 blocks out of 60 (36.7%)**. A separate pre-release source replay records
4/60 blocks, including 2/57 strictly qualified cases; three existing fixture
errors remain. These are selected examples, not a general false-positive rate.
Try it on your own changes before making it required. [Coverage and limitations](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/stability.md#coverage-and-adoption-cost)

## Use it in CI

To stop a merge, make the **`checkwash` status check required** in your
repository's branch rules. Installing the tool or adding a workflow alone
does not enforce its verdict.

The recommended Action is pinned to **v0.6.0**; the CLI above is **v0.7.0**.
The prior-release Action includes the published v0.6.0 engine. It lacks the
subsequent helper, Git input, JS/TS catch and other fixes in this candidate.
Record which version you use. [Full setup and exemptions](https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash/blob/main/docs/enterprise.md)

<a id="required-check--the-only-configuration-that-blocks-a-merge"></a>
<details>
<summary>Copy the GitHub Actions workflow and require the check</summary>

Save this as `.github/workflows/checkwash.yml`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/checkwash.yml
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  checkwash:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: actions/setup-python@5fda3b95a4ea91299a34e894583c3862153e4b97 # v7.0.0
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      - uses: taipei49314/checkwash/action@8c70efbf93975bf3210acb8eafbaf4b38044a770 # v0.6.0
```

After the workflow runs, open **Settings → Rules → Rulesets** and require
the `checkwash` status context. Keep the job unconditional.

If you administer the repository and have this project's ruleset file,
you can instead create the rule with:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets --method POST --input action/required-ruleset.json
```

This adds a ruleset; it does not replace existing ones. `checkwash doctor`
can inspect the local workflow, but cannot verify live branch protection.

**Why the older Action pin?** A release cannot embed its own commit SHA,
so the documented Action adopts a verified pin from the prior release.
The recommended v0.6.0 Action includes the engine published on 2026-10-05,
but not the later fixes in this v0.7.0 candidate. A CLI
upgrade does not update an existing Action. To verify another trusted release, use
`git rev-parse 'vX.Y.Z^{commit}'`.

## More options and evidence

<a id="install"></a>
<details>
<summary>Install as a CLI or try the included examples</summary>

If you already use pipx, install the fixed version:

```bash
pipx install checkwash==0.7.0
# or from the release tag:
pipx install git+https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash@v0.7.0

checkwash check HEAD~1..HEAD
checkwash demo                  # 8 real tampering cases, blocked, offline
```

`checkwash demo` replays eight real tampering cases and one honest fix.
It illustrates known patterns; it is not a coverage guarantee.
You can run the same examples with `python checkwash.pyz demo`.

<a id="measured-not-asserted"></a>
<details>
<summary>Read the measurements and their limits</summary>

The historical six-repo sweep recorded **46 / 1800 = 2.56%** blocks:
**31 false positives (1.72%)**, 15 legitimate
  policy blocks (0.83%). The tracked artifacts record engine **v0.3.0**
(the release commit, swept 2026-09-07) on a corpus used to tune the
detectors, not a held-out result.

**1.33% of the corpus (24/1800) records opaque production changes**.
That flag does not establish that each verdict changed or each diff was unanalyzed.

Review methods vary: the three-rater agreement study covers an older
35-diff cohort, not all 46 blocks. The dedicated **22/60 refactor** result
(`benchmarks/refactors/results-latest.json`, a dated v0.3.1 snapshot) is a
separate population; the general-commit rate does not predict it.
