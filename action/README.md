# checkwash GitHub Action

Composite action that installs this repository and runs `checkwash check`
against the PR (or `HEAD~1` on a push).

## Caller workflow

Copy the hash-pinned snippet in the root [README](../README.md).
A tag pin (`actions/checkout@v4`, `taipei49314/checkwash/action@vX.Y.Z`)
fails zizmor's default `unpinned-uses` policy. The SHA in the root snippet is
also `doctor`'s built-in verified checkwash pin: the peeled commit of the trusted
tag named in the `git ls-remote` line below, not the annotated tag object. A release cannot embed its own commit SHA, so release
N advances this pin only after it exists, in release N+1. This deliberate
one-release trust lag is why the Action pin can differ from the CLI install tag.

Required in the *caller* workflow, not in this composite file:

- `permissions: contents: read`
- `persist-credentials: false` on checkout
- 40-character commit SHAs on every `uses:`

`setup-python` is in the snippet because the composite runs
`python -m pip install`. The runner image is not a supported Python.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `fail-on` | `high` | Severity that fails the job |
| `base` | PR base SHA, else `HEAD~1` | Left side of the range |
| `comment-pr` | `false` | If `true`, post one review comment per high finding (T2.2) |

`comment-pr: true` needs `pull-requests: write` on the *caller* workflow.
The engine never opens a network socket. If the token cannot write, the
comment step prints a soft-fail and the check verdict still stands.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
# ...
- uses: taipei49314/checkwash/action@<sha>   # same 40-char SHA as the root README snippet
  with:
    comment-pr: true
```

Inputs are passed into the script through `env:`, not interpolated into
`run:`. zizmor 1.29.0 flags `${{ inputs.* }}` inside a `run` block as
`template-injection`.

## Require the check

The job name in the README snippet is `checkwash`. That is the status-check
context. After the workflow has run once:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets --method POST --input action/required-ruleset.json
```

The payload is [required-ruleset.json](required-ruleset.json). It targets
`~DEFAULT_BRANCH` and does not replace other rulesets. Admin `repo` scope
is required. `doctor` cannot see whether this ran.

## Pin lookup

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/checkout.git refs/tags/v7.0.1
git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/setup-python.git refs/tags/v7.0.0
git ls-remote https://github.com/taipei49314/checkwash.git 'refs/tags/v0.6.0^{}'
```
